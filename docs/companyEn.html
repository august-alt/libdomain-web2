        >Basealt Ltd. is the developer of Russian ALT operating systems. The
        company has more than 20 years of experience in software development. We
        employ over 120 developers, programmers and technical specialists.
        Basealt Ltd. develops solutions and releases distributions using its own
        technologies and tools. The independent Sisyphus repository serves as
        the base of all these solutions and distributions. It is one of the
        world's largest banks of free software packages with maintained
        consistency. The repository was created in 2001. As of today, it
        contains about 20,000 packages. Sisyphus is based on software-building
        technologies which take into account the inter-program dependencies, as
        well as on tried and tested developer interaction processes. This
        repository allows for making a stable branch (software platform) from
        time to time, which is then maintained for a long time and is used as
        the base for building the next generation of ALT distributions. The
        Sisyphus repository is currently available for the following
        architectures: x86, x86_64, aarch64, armh, RISC-V, MIPS, ppc64le. Works
        on porting it to other platforms are under way. Distributions of ALT
        operating systems are designed to allow integration between one another,
        which makes it possible to build information systems of any scale, as
        well as to work in heterogeneous networks.</span
